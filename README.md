The software package 'buildenh' enhances the classification results of remote sensing imagery by generalizing the content and vectorizing the irregular outlines of imaged objects. Vector data of urban environments are generated in an automated way and with high cartographic quality. The user may monitor the intermediate results which are displayed graphically together with the source data. The derived coordinates of the corner points may be stored together with a label in topographic databases and Geographic Information Systems. The package has the potential to contribute to national and private mapping projects and to crowd sourcing. 

A detailed description of the package 'buildenh' and an installation guide are located in the directory /docs. All R scripts are in the /R directory. Supporting scripts may be found in the /support directory and solutions for special objects (buildings) can be collected in the directory /spObj. The package is started by the program 'startup_buildenh.R'. Several parameters have to set. Use the parameter proc_mode = "demo" for starting with an example to get acquainted with the software. Suggestions for parameters of other objects and a second orthoimage are contained in the tables "table_ISPRS1.pdf" and "table_ISPRS7.pdf" which are stored in the subdirectory /data/ISPRSx. After experiences with the examples you may wish to start with your own data.
